# Description
In above file you can determine sin^m(x) ,cos^n(x),sin^m(x)*cos^n(x)
<br>You have to enter the limit in format of (0,pie/2),(0,pie),(0,2pie)
<br>or else you can not determine the anwser
<br>The answer is not in simplify form you have to simplify for further


# Example

In above example we find the answer of integral whose limit is 0 to pie/2
<br> we insert the degree of sinx and cosx
<br> finally we get our answer 120/10395
